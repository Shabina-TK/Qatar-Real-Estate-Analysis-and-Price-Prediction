# 🏡 Qatar Real Estate Analysis and Price Prediction

A data analysis and forecasting project using real estate transaction data from the **Qatar Open Data Portal**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze real estate transactions in Qatar to uncover insights about price trends, property types, and location-based variations. Additionally, a price prediction model is developed to forecast future real estate values using Python. The project is divided into three major parts:

- **API Scraping of Real Estate Data** from the Qatar Government Open Data Portal  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **(Upcoming)** Power BI Dashboard for visual representation
